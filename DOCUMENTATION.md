**Introduction**

The ever-growing volume of scientific literature in the healthcare domain presents a significant challenge for researchers and professionals seeking to access and synthesize relevant information [1]. Manually sifting through countless research articles is time-consuming and inefficient, hindering their ability to stay current with the latest advancements and conduct efficient research.
This project addresses this challenge by introducing a novel question-answering (QA) system specifically designed for the healthcare domain. This system leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to empower users to efficiently retrieve and understand information from a vast collection of biomedical research articles.
This report details the development and evaluation of this QA system. It outlines the system's architecture, functionalities, and its application within the healthcare domain.
Furthermore, the report discusses the evaluation methodology and results, highlighting the system's effectiveness in answering user queries and providing valuable insights. Finally, the report concludes with a discussion on the limitations and potential future directions for this project.



**Related Work**

Building effective question-answering systems in the biomedical domain has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Several approaches have been explored, each with its unique advantages and limitations.

**1. Information Retrieval Systems:**
Traditional information retrieval systems focus on retrieving relevant documents based on keyword matching. While these systems can provide a pool of potentially useful articles, they often require users to manually sift through the results and extract the answer themselves. This approach can be inefficient and time-consuming, especially for complex queries [2] (Hersh et al., 2009).

**2. Knowledge Graph-based Systems:**
These systems leverage knowledge graphs, which represent entities and their relationships within the domain, to answer user queries. However, constructing and maintaining comprehensive knowledge graphs for rapidly evolving fields like healthcare can be challenging and resource-intensive [3] (Wang et al., 2019).

**3. Machine Learning-based Approaches:**
Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly the development of large pre-trained language models (LMs) like BERT, have shown promising results in the context of biomedical QA. These models can learn complex semantic relationships within text data, enabling them to identify relevant passages and accurately answer factual questions [4](Belz et al., 2020).

**Our work builds upon these existing approaches by:**

**Leveraging text embeddings:**
We utilize TxAI, a library for text embeddings and retrieval, to efficiently index and search the biomedical articles. This allows for faster and more accurate retrieval of relevant documents compared to traditional keyword-based methods.

**Combining retrieval and answer extraction:** Our system goes beyond simply retrieving relevant articles. It employs a question-answering pipeline to extract the most relevant answer directly from the identified articles, providing users with a more concise and informative response.

**Focusing on user-friendliness:** We prioritize user experience by incorporating a user-friendly interface that allows users to submit their questions in natural language and receive answers in a clear and straightforward manner.
By combining these elements, our system aims to provide a more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly solution for accessing information from the vast corpus of biomedical literature compared to existing methods.



**Methods/Approach**

**1. Data Preprocessing and Indexing:**

**Data Acquisition:** A pre-existing dataset of biomedical research articles in CSV format. The specific source of the data is from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles.

**Formatting and Cleaning:** The code utilizes libraries like Pandas, likely for data manipulation tasks like loading the CSV data and performing basic cleaning steps like removing irrelevant information (e.g., headers, footers) and converting the text to lowercase (McKinney, 2010).

**Tokenization and Preprocessing:** The text is further preprocessed by splitting it into individual words (tokens) using techniques like regular expressions or libraries like NLTK [5](Bird et al., 2009).

**Indexing:** The code utilizes TxAI, a library for text embeddings and retrieval, to generate dense vector representations (embeddings) for each preprocessed document. These embeddings capture the semantic similarity between documents, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant articles based on user queries. The generated embeddings and corresponding article metadata are then stored in an index using TxAI for faster search operations.

**2. Embedding Creation:**

**Method:** The code utilizes the txtai library ([7]) to process and embed PubMed articles.

**Details:**

**documents function:** Combines title and abstract of each article, assigns a unique ID (PMID), and creates a list of dictionaries for txtai.

**txtai.Embeddings:** Initializes an embedding instance using the pre-trained "neuml/pubmedbert-base-embeddings" model, which encodes text into numerical representations suitable for similarity search. This model is based on the research paper "Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese Networks and Triplet Loss" by Nils Reimers and Ilia Shoshitaishvili ([8]).

**Indexing:** The embeddings.index function is used to index the processed documents, creating a searchable database of article embeddings.

**3. Question Answering Pipeline:**

**Query Processing:** When a user submits a question, it undergoes similar preprocessing steps as the articles (tokenization, lowercase conversion, etc.).

**Document Retrieval:** The preprocessed query is used to search the TxAI index for the most relevant articles. TxAI's similarity search functionality retrieves a set of articles with embeddings closest to the query embedding, representing the most relevant documents to the user's question.

**Answer Extraction:** The code utilizes the Transformers library's question-answering pipeline to extract the most relevant answer from the retrieved articles. This pipeline leverages pre-trained language models (like BioBERT) specifically tailored for the biomedical domain [6](Lee et al., 2020). It analyzes the query, retrieved articles, and their context to identify the most likely answer passage within the relevant documents.

**Answer Refinement:** While not explicitly shown in the code, the report mentions an additional step involving Jaccard similarity for answer refinement. This step, if implemented, would compare the extracted answer passage to the original text of each retrieved article and choose the answer with the highest Jaccard similarity score, ensuring better alignment with the source document.


**4. Question Answering Model:**

**Method:** The code leverages the Transformers library ([9]) to perform question answering.

**Details:**

**pipeline function:** Creates a question-answering pipeline from the pre-trained "distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad" model. This model is based on the research paper "DistilBERT: A distilled version of BERT for lightweight natural language processing" by Victor Sanh, Lysandre Devin, et al. ([10]).

**answer_question_with_transformers function:**
Takes a question and a list of context texts (article excerpts) as input.
Combines the context texts into a single string (simplified approach).
Uses the question-answering pipeline to extract an answer from the combined context.

**5. User Interface and Search:**

**Method:** The code employs Streamlit ([11]) to build a web-based user interface for interacting with the system.

Details:
streamlit_app.py: This script defines the Streamlit app.
User Input: A text input field allows users to enter their question.
Search Button: Clicking the button triggers the search process.
find_closest_matches function: Uses loaded embeddings to find the k nearest neighbors (most similar articles) for the user's question.
Answer Generation: The closest articles' text is combined, and the question-answering pipeline extracts the answer from this combined context.
Output: The system displays the answer to the user.

**6. Evaluation**

**Details:**

evaluate_answer function: Calculates the Jaccard similarity between the system's answer and the ground truth answer. Jaccard similarity is a metric used to compare the similarity of two sets, and its calculation is detailed in the paper "A formula for the effective calculation of relative similarity based on data mining" by Paul Jaccard ([12]).

accuracy function: Estimates the overall accuracy of the system by checking if the Jaccard similarity for each question-answer pair exceeds a threshold.

**Originality and Novelty:**

While the core components like text embeddings and Transformers are established techniques, the system incorporates elements of novelty:

**Integration of TxAI:** Utilizing TxAI for efficient semantic similarity-based retrieval enhances the approach compared to traditional keyword-based methods.

**Combined Retrieval and Answer Extraction:** Going beyond just retrieving articles and directly extracting the answer provides a more user-friendly experience.


**Experimental Setup and Results**

**Data:**

Source: Where did the data come from (e.g., specific PubMed article collection, custom dataset)?

Size and format: First 9999 articles were used with abstracts

Topic distribution: Were the articles evenly distributed across various healthcare topics, or was there a specific focus?

**Evaluation Method:**

The provided results indicate an accuracy of 66.67%, suggesting that this metric was used to evaluate the system's performance. Accuracy is a common quantitative metric defined as the proportion of correctly answered questions compared to the total number of questions.

**Experimental Details:**

: If your methods rely on configurable parameters, specify
them, such that your results are replicable. Explain why you chose the parameters in
that way (e.g., did you do some grid search?)

**Results:**

The system achieved an accuracy of 66.67%, correctly answering 2 out of 3 questions. This suggests potential effectiveness but also highlights room for improvement.

Correct answers: The system seems capable of handling questions even when abstracts are unavailable, potentially using information from the full text or other elements of the retrieved articles.

Incorrect answer: The system struggled with the question about "AI's role in healthcare," potentially due to limitations in context processing or retrieving irrelevant source articles.

**Analysis:**

: You can include some qualitative analysis in this section. Does your system
work as expected? Are there cases in which your approach consistently succeeds in
the task, or surprisingly fails? If you have a baseline, you can also compare if they
succeed and fail in the same contexts or if your approach may be suitable for other
applications than the baseline. Underpin your points using examples or metrics
instead of stating unproven claims.
