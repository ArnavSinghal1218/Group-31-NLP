1. Imports:

requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the PubMed API to retrieve abstracts.
json: Used to parse and work with JSON data (returned by PubMed).
xml.etree.ElementTree: Used to parse the XML response from PubMed for detailed information about the articles.
time: Used for pausing between retries in case of errors.
tqdm (not used in the provided code snippet): Used to display progress bars.
multiprocessing: Used to enable parallel processing of multiple tasks for efficiency.
Pool and Manager from multiprocessing: Used to manage worker processes and shared data structures for multiprocessing.

2. Function: get_abstract(id, failure_time=0)

Retrieves the abstract of a single article specified by its ID from PubMed.
Sets a base URL for the PubMed API endpoint for fetching abstracts.
Constructs the complete URL for the specific article using the provided ID.
Defines headers for the HTTP request to mimic a web browser.
Attempts to fetch the abstract using requests.get.
Parses the XML response using ElementTree.
Extracts the abstract text, author names, URL, title, and article IDs.
Handles potential errors:
If the abstract is not found, returns None for all extracted data.
If the request fails, retries up to 2 times with a 1-second delay between attempts before giving up and returning None for all data.

3. Function: get_abstract_multiproc(proc_num, ...)

Designed for use within the multiprocessing framework.
Takes various arguments, including process number, total processes, a lock object, and shared data structures (lists).
Iterates through a list of article IDs assigned to the process.
For each ID, calls get_abstract to retrieve the corresponding abstract and related data.
Uses a lock to synchronize access to shared data structures (lists) across multiple processes to prevent conflicts.
Appends the retrieved abstract, author list, URL, title, and article ID to the respective shared lists if successful.
If get_abstract fails, adds the failed article ID to a separate list for tracking.
