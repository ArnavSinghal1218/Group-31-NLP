38336420,"The impact of austerity on children: Uncovering effect heterogeneity by political, economic, and family factors in low- and middle-income countries.","Which children are most vulnerable when their government imposes austerity? Research tends to focus on either the political-economic level or the family level. Using a sample of nearly two million children in 67 countries, this study synthesizes theories from family sociology and political science to examine the heterogeneous effects on child poverty of economic shocks following the implementation of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. To discover effect heterogeneity, we apply machine learning to policy evaluation. We find that children's average probability of falling into poverty increases by 14 percentage points. We find substantial effect heterogeneity, with family wealth and governments' education spending as the two most important moderators. In contrast to studies that emphasize the vulnerability of low-income families, we find that middle-class children face an equally high risk of poverty. Our results show that synthesizing family and political factors yield deeper knowledge of how economic shocks affect children.",2024,"What is the average increase in the probability of children falling into poverty after an IMF program is implemented?

38333196,Helix-based screening with structure prediction using artificial intelligence has potential for the rapid development of peptide inhibitors targeting class I viral fusion.,"The rapid development of drugs against emerging and re-emerging viruses is required to prevent future pandemics. However, inhibitors usually take a long time to optimize. Here, to improve the optimization step, we used two heptad repeats (HR) in the spike protein (S protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a model and established a screening system for peptide-based inhibitors containing an α-helix region (SPICA). SPICA can be used to identify critical amino acid regions and evaluate the inhibitory effects of peptides as decoys. We further employed an artificial intelligence structure-prediction system (AlphaFold2) for the rapid analysis of structure-activity relationships. Here, we identified that critical amino acid regions, DVDLGD (amino acids 1163-1168 in the S protein), IQKEIDRLNE (1179-1188), and NLNESLIDL (1192-1200), played a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 fusion. Peptides containing these critical amino acid regions efficiently blocked viral replication. We also demonstrated that AlphaFold2 could successfully predict structures similar to the reported crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures of the post-fusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Notably, the predicted structures of the HR1 region and the peptide-based fusion inhibitors corresponded well with the antiviral effects of each fusion inhibitor. Thus, the combination of SPICA and AlphaFold2 is a powerful tool to design viral fusion inhibitors using only the amino-acid sequence of the fusion protein.",2024,"What are the two heptad repeats (HR) used in the study?

38332759,Assessment of Situation Awareness Conflict Risk between Human and AI in Process System Operation.,"The conflict between human and artificial intelligence is a critical issue, which has recently been introduced in Process System Engineering, capturing the observation and action conflicts. Interpretation conflict is another source of potential conflict that can cause serious concern for process safety as it is often perceived as confusion, surprise, or a mistake. It is intangible and associated with situation awareness. However, interpretation conflict has not been studied with the required emphasis. The current work proposes a novel methodology to quantify interpretation conflict probability and risk. The methodology is demonstrated, tested, and validated on a two-phase separator. The results show that interpretation conflict is usually hidden, mixed, or covered by traditional faults, and noises in observation and interpretation, including sensor faults, logic errors, cyberattacks, human mistakes, and misunderstandings, may easily trigger interpretation conflict. The proposed methodology will serve as a mechanism to develop strategies to manage interpretation conflict.",2023,"What two types of conflict are mentioned in the context of Process System Engineering?

38332605,When Will Death Be? Legal Considerations and Regulatory Safeguards in Predictive Modelling Applications for End-of-Life Care.,"Advance care planning (ACP) is generally considered as valuable in guiding treatments that are aligned with patients' preferences. Despite its benefits, there are some practical and legal difficulties in its implementation. Predictive modelling is increasingly used in clinical decision-making, for example, in predicting patients' life expectancy, thus enabling clinicians to initiate timely ACP conversations. This development could transform the way end-of-life conversations are implemented. In this article we advocate for the use of predictive modelling in assisting clinicians to initiate ACP conversations provided several safeguards are in place to address ethical concerns that arise. Predictive modelling applications resolve several practical and legal difficulties in conducting end-of-life conversations. Ethical concerns such as explicability, accountability, trustworthiness and reliability of these models in clinical settings are important considerations. However, safeguards are needed to address these ethical concerns to ensure the models are appropriately supportive of patient needs and interests.",2023,"What is the main benefit of using advance care planning (ACP) according to the abstract?

38332598,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Issues When Determining Negligence.,"The introduction of novel medical technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), into traditional clinical practice presents legal liability challenges that need to be squarely addressed by litigants and courts when something goes wrong. Some of the most promising applications for the use of AI in medicine will lead to vexed liability questions. As AI in health care is in its relative infancy, there is a paucity of case law globally upon which to draw. This article analyses medical malpractice where AI is involved, what problems arise when applying the tort of negligence - such as establishing the essential elements of breach of duty of care and causation - and how can these can be addressed. Product liability under Australian Consumer Law is beyond the scope of this article. In order to address this question, the article: (1) identifies the general problems that black box AI causes in the health care sector; (2) identifies the problems that will arise in establishing breach and causation due to the ""black box"" nature of AI, with reference to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and common law through two hypothetical examples; and (3) considers selected legal solutions to the problems caused by ""black box"" AI.",2023,"What is the legal challenge presented by the introduction of AI into medicine, according to the abstract?

38328471,Artificial neural network models: implementation of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based spontaneous lie detection in an interactive scenario.,"Deception is an inevitable occurrence in daily life. Various methods have been used to understand the mechanisms underlying brain deception. Moreover, numerous efforts have been undertaken to detect deception and truth-telling. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has great potential for neurological applications compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, an fNIRS-based spontaneous lie detection model was used in the present study. We interviewed 10 healthy subjects to identify deception using the fNIRS system. A card game frequently referred to as a bluff or cheat was introduced. This game was selected because its rules are ideal for testing our hypotheses. The optical probe of the fNIRS was placed on the subject's forehead, and we acquired optical density signals, which were then converted into oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin signals using the Modified Beer-Lambert law. The oxy-hemoglobin signal was preprocessed to eliminate noise. In this study, we proposed three artificial neural networks inspired by deep learning models, including AlexNet, ResNet, and GoogleNet, to classify deception and truth-telling. The proposed models achieved accuracies of 88.5%, 88.0%, and 90.0%, respectively. These proposed models were compared with other classification models, including k-nearest neighbor, linear support vector machines (SVM), quadratic SVM, cubic SVM, simple decision trees, and complex decision trees. These comparisons showed that the proposed models performed better than the other state-of-the-art methods.",2023,"What type of brain imaging technique is used in the study to detect deception?

Its intricate nature makes it challenging to study solely based on biological knowledge, often leading to expensive research endeavors. While tremendous strides have been made in understanding cancer, gaps remain, especially in predicting tumor behavior across various stages. The integration of artificial intelligence in oncology research has accelerated our insights into tumor behavior, right from its genesis to metastasis. Nevertheless, there's a pressing need for a holistic understanding of the interactions between cancer cells, their microenvironment, and their subsequent interplay with the broader body environment. In this landscape, deep learning emerges as a potent tool with its multifaceted applications in diverse scientific challenges. Motivated by this, our study presents a novel approach to modeling cancer tumor growth from a molecular dynamics' perspective, harnessing the capabilities of deep-learning cellular automata. This not only facilitates a microscopic examination of tumor behavior and growth but also delves deeper into its overarching behavioral patterns. Our work primarily focused on evaluating the developed tumor growth model through the proposed network, followed by a rigorous compatibility check with traditional mathematical tumor growth models using R and Matlab software. The outcomes notably aligned with the Gompertz growth model, accentuating the robustness of our approach.

38325294,IMPACT OF MOTHER'S HYPOTHYROIDISM ON FETAL DEVELOPMENT AND OUTCOMES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.,"The thyroid, a gland with a butterfly-like shape in the base of the human neck, plays an important role in metabolism. Body heat, energy levels, weight, hair, fingernail, and regular menstruation cycles are controlled by three hormones produced by the thyroid. A system of feedback regulates the release of those hormones. Overproduction as well as underproduction of thyroid hormones can result from shifts in the stimulation and regulation of those hormones. These factors can have physiological or pathological origins. Pregnancy is a physiological factor. There is a plethora of physiological and psychological shifts that occur during pregnancy. A thyroid alteration in the mother is one example. Thyroid irregularities result from a failure to adjust to new circumstances. Thyroid hormone levels can drop, or manufacturing could be slowed during pregnancy due to variations in hormone concentration. Hypothyroidism describes this disorder. Hypothyroidism in women who are pregnant is either gestational or could be a disorder that is present before pregnancy. Gestational hypothyroidism cures itself throughout postpartum times, though it can stay as subclinical hyperthyroidism for some time after delivery. They pose a serious risk to development, stunt the growth of the unborn child and lead to defects in subsequent generations. Enhanced thyroid binding globulin levels, enhanced iodine clearance by the kidneys, modified effects of the human reproductive hormone and reduced dietary consumption of iodine lead to these alterations in the gland. Cretinism and mental disorders are among the serious health problems related to an iodine imbalance in maternal hypothyroidism. The growth of the brain, nervous system and Intelligence of an unborn child depends on thyroid hormones. As a result, normal early stages of development suffer due to changes in maternal hormone levels.",2023,"What is the function of the thyroid gland in the human body?

Using cartography as a research method, we follow the paths, connections, and construction of femininities, activated and performed by our respondents to establish a place of respect and prominence within and outside the Institution, using beauty as an aesthetic and discursive power tool based on the DeleGata performative class. Cartographic interviews were conducted with nine female police chiefs in Rio de Janeiro state aged 30 to 59. Although the police have historically valued recognized masculine ideals, such as strength and virility, the gender performativities operated by female police chiefs allow for police feminization. The figure/enunciation of DeleGata, who builds an image of the female police chief, implying a unity, signifies producing political subjects, ideas, and values that reach a communicative and performative standard, making visible some woman who adorns - with her beauty - and simultaneously surprises - with her intelligence. The DeleGata thus brings into play apparently antagonistic extremes: beauty-intelligence, sensuality-power, femininity-strength, producing a social and symbolic regimen for the production of bodies and femininities.",2024,"What is the research method used in this article to study the performative gender constructions of female police chiefs?

On the other hand, beauty - as a political and transformative field - is one of the main elements that travestis have to find their place in the world through their (trans)national displacements: they are self-constructing as social subjects who claim some intelligibility while they become beautiful travestis. Therefore, travestis believe that beauty is a (transitory) space of liberation that, ultimately, reveals how certain biopolitical technologies have failed to produce undisciplined bodies and beautiful travestis who - through their survival - rebel against a heteronormative power that considers that their bodies are not worthy of mourning and, consequently, ""deserve to die"".",2024,"What group of people does the study focus on, and where was the ethnographic research conducted?

38322797,NeuroAIreh@b: an artificial intelligence-based methodology for personalized and adaptive neurorehabilitation.,"Cognitive impairments are a prevalent consequence of acquired brain injury, dementia, and age-related cognitive decline, hampering individuals' daily functioning and independence, with significant societal and economic implications. While neurorehabilitation represents a promising avenue for addressing these deficits, traditional rehabilitation approaches face notable limitations. First, they lack adaptability, offering one-size-fits-all solutions that may not effectively meet each patient's unique needs. Furthermore, the resource-intensive nature of these interventions, often confined to clinical settings, poses barriers to widespread, cost-effective, and sustained implementation, resulting in suboptimal outcomes in terms of intervention adaptability, intensity, and duration. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces NeuroAIreh@b, an innovative cognitive profiling and training methodology that uses an AI-driven framework to optimize neurorehabilitation prescription. NeuroAIreh@b effectively bridges the gap between neuropsychological assessment and computational modeling, thereby affording highly personalized and adaptive neurorehabilitation sessions. This approach also leverages virtual reality-based simulations of daily living activities to enhance ecological validity and efficacy. The feasibility of NeuroAIreh@b has already been demonstrated through a clinical study with stroke patients employing a tablet-based intervention. The NeuroAIreh@b methodology holds the potential for efficacy studies in large randomized controlled trials in the future.",2023,"What are the negative consequences of cognitive impairments on individuals and society?

38322327,"Targeting cAMP in D1-MSNs in the nucleus accumbens, a new rapid antidepressant strategy.","Studies have suggested that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression; however, the regulatory strategy that targets the NAc to achieve an exclusive and outstanding anti-depression benefit has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a specific reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the subset of dopamine D1 receptor medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in the NAc that promoted stress susceptibility, while the stimulation of cAMP production in NAc D1-MSNs efficiently rescued depression-like behaviors. Ketamine treatment enhanced cAMP both in D1-MSNs and dopamine D2 receptor medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) of depressed mice, however, the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine solely depended on elevating cAMP in NAc D1-MSNs. We discovered that a higher dose of crocin markedly increased cAMP in the NAc and consistently relieved depression 24 h after oral administration, but not a lower dose. The fast onset property of crocin was verified through multicenter studies. Moreover, crocin specifically targeted at D1-MSN cAMP signaling in the NAc to relieve depression and had no effect on D2-MSN. These findings characterize a new strategy to achieve an exclusive and outstanding anti-depression benefit by elevating cAMP in D1-MSNs in the NAc, and provide a potential rapid antidepressant drug candidate, crocin.",2024,"What part of the brain is implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression, according to the study?

38322152,Multimodal Gated Mixture of Experts Using Whole Slide Image and Flow Cytometry for Multiple Instance Learning Classification of Lymphoma.,"In this study, we present a deep-learning-based multimodal classification method for lymphoma diagnosis in digital pathology, which utilizes a whole slide image (WSI) as the primary image data and flow cytometry (FCM) data as auxiliary information. In pathological diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, FCM serves as valuable auxiliary information during the diagnosis process, offering useful insights into predicting the major class (superclass) of subtypes. By incorporating both images and FCM data into the classification process, we can develop a method that mimics the diagnostic process of pathologists, enhancing the explainability. In order to incorporate the hierarchical structure between superclasses and their subclasses, the proposed method utilizes a network structure that effectively combines the mixture of experts (MoE) and multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques, where MIL is widely recognized for its effectiveness in handling WSIs in digital pathology. The MoE network in the proposed method consists of a gating network for superclass classification and multiple expert networks for (sub)class classification, specialized for each superclass. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments involving a six-class classification task using 600 lymphoma cases. The proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 72.3%, surpassing the 69.5% obtained through the straightforward combination of FCM and images, as well as the 70.2% achieved by the method using only images. Moreover, the combination of multiple weights in the MoE and MIL allows for the visualization of specific cellular and tumor regions, resulting in a highly explanatory model that cannot be attained with conventional methods. It is anticipated that by targeting a larger number of classes and increasing the number of expert networks, the proposed method could be effectively applied to the real problem of lymphoma diagnosis.",2024,"What type of deep learning approach is used in the study for lymphoma diagnosis?

38317836,Multi-scenario pear tree inflorescence detection based on improved YOLOv7 object detection algorithm.,"Efficient and precise thinning during the orchard blossom period is a crucial factor in enhancing both fruit yield and quality. The accurate recognition of inflorescence is the cornerstone of intelligent blossom equipment. To advance the process of intelligent blossom thinning, this paper addresses the issue of suboptimal performance of current inflorescence recognition algorithms in detecting dense inflorescence at a long distance. It introduces an inflorescence recognition algorithm, YOLOv7-E, based on the YOLOv7 neural network model. YOLOv7 incorporates an efficient multi-scale attention mechanism (EMA) to enable cross-channel feature interaction through parallel processing strategies, thereby maximizing the retention of pixel-level features and positional information on the feature maps. Additionally, the SPPCSPC module is optimized to preserve target area features as much as possible under different receptive fields, and the Soft-NMS algorithm is employed to reduce the likelihood of missing detections in overlapping regions. The model is trained on a diverse dataset collected from real-world field settings. Upon validation, the improved YOLOv7-E object detection algorithm achieves an average precision and recall of 91.4% and 89.8%, respectively, in inflorescence detection under various time periods, distances, and weather conditions. The detection time for a single image is 80.9 ms, and the model size is 37.6 Mb. In comparison to the original YOLOv7 algorithm, it boasts a 4.9% increase in detection accuracy and a 5.3% improvement in recall rate, with a mere 1.8% increase in model parameters. The YOLOv7-E object detection algorithm presented in this study enables precise inflorescence detection and localization across an entire tree at varying distances, offering robust technical support for differentiated and precise blossom thinning operations by thinning machinery in the future.",2023,"What agricultural task is the research focused on improving?

This paper aims to overview the ability of new treatment options to promote endoscopic and histological healing and to discuss the prognostic significance of endoscopic and histological outcomes. The analysis included randomized-controlled trials (published since 2020) focused on the impact of pharmacological interventions on endoscopic and histological remission in IBD. Even though the Mayo endoscopic subscore is routinely used, the application of validated scoring systems for ulcerative colitis is uncommon. In Crohn's disease (CD), the application of endoscopic scores remains limited to clinical studies. The standardized evaluation of histological features has been performed in several recent ulcerative colitis trials, resorting mostly to the Geboes score and the Nancy histological index. Still, the use of histological scores for CD remains elusive. Current evidence underscores that histological remission conveys the best long-term prognosis, supporting the inclusion of histology as a treatment guide in ulcerative colitis. In CD, data are promising but originated from a few retrospective studies. Further efforts are warranted to: (1) use validated histological indexes for ulcerative colitis, aiming their adoption as treatment targets; (2) promote the validation and utilization of histological scores for CD, at least in clinical studies; (3) confirm the prognostic impact of histological remission in CD; (4) integrate artificial intelligence assets to support grading, particularly in the setting of histology; (5) prospectively define the monitoring frequency of IBD patients who achieved histological remission.",2024,"What is the primary long-term treatment goal in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), according to the abstract?
