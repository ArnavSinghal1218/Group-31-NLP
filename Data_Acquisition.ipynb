Based on the Japanese CTO PCI expert registry, the J-Channel score was developed to predict CC crossing. We examined the performance of the J-Channel score in patients who underwent retrograde CTO-PCI at 31 centers between 2013-2023 as part of the Prospective Global Registry for the Study of CTO Intervention (PROGRESS-CTO). We observed an association between successful CC crossing and the J-Channel score, its predictive efficacy was modest for both wire and microcatheter crossing.\n",
            "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most aggressive, heterogenous, and fatal types of human cancer for which screening, and more effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed. Early-stage detection and treatment greatly improve the 5-year survival rate. In the era of targeted therapies for all types of cancer, a complete metabolomic profile is mandatory before neoadjuvant therapy to assign the correct drugs and check the response to the treatment given. The aim of this study is to discover specific metabolic biomarkers or a sequence of metabolomic indicators that possess precise diagnostic capabilities in predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy. After searching the keywords, a total of 108 articles were identified during a timeframe of 10 years (2013-2023). Within this set, one article was excluded due to the use of non-English language. Six scientific papers were qualified for this investigation after eliminating all duplicates, publications not referring to the subject matter, open access restriction papers, and those not applicable to humans. Biomolecular analysis found a correlation between metabolomic analysis of colorectal cancer samples and poor progression-free survival rates. Biomarkers are instrumental in predicting a patient's response to specific treatments, guiding the selection of targeted therapies, and indicating resistance to certain drugs.\n",
            "Subtle loss of functionality in healthy older adults is considered one of the most important predictors of cognitive decline. Neurocognitive interventions are increasingly being used, from a preventive maintenance approach to functional capacity. This study evaluates the effectiveness of different neurocognitive approaches on the functionality of healthy older adults. In this systematic review (CRD42023473944), an extensive search was conducted for articles published in the last 10 years (2013-2023) in the following databases: Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 809 trials were identified, of which 18 were considered to be eligible for inclusion in the review. The data revealed heterogeneity in sample size, measures of functional assessment, neurocognitive interventions used, number of sessions, session duration, and time. Traditional cognitive stimulation is shown to have no significant functional benefit, while other less commonly used neurocognitive interventions, such as those based on everyday cognition, are associated with more significant benefits. Moreover, it is demonstrated that although the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL) is the most used test in similar studies, it is not sensitive enough to detect changes in functionality in healthy elderly individuals, with other tests such as the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) being more advantageous. Therefore, a new guideline is proposed for its use in clinical practice and research, using homogeneous study protocols and neurocognitive interventions that allow for the transfer and generalization of results in daily life.\n",
            "Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted tremendous interest ever since the isolation of atomically thin sheets of graphene in 2004 due to the specific and versatile properties of these materials. However, the increasing production and use of 2D materials necessitate a thorough evaluation of the potential impact on human health and the environment. Furthermore, harmonized test protocols are needed with which to assess the safety of 2D materials. The Graphene Flagship project (2013-2023), funded by the European Commission, addressed the identification of the possible hazard of graphene-based materials as well as emerging 2D materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, and others. Additionally, so-called green chemistry approaches were explored to achieve the goal of a safe and sustainable production and use of this fascinating family of nanomaterials. The present review provides a compact survey of the findings and the lessons learned in the Graphene Flagship.\n",

            "Deep brain stimulation has been in clinical use for 30 years and during that time it has changed markedly from a small-scale treatment employed by only a few highly specialized centers into a widespread keystone approach to the management of disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In the intervening decades, many of the broad principles of deep brain stimulation have remained unchanged, that of electrode insertion into stereotactically targeted brain nuclei, however the underlying technology and understanding around the approach have progressed markedly. Some of the most significant advances have taken place over the last decade with the advent of artificial intelligence, directional electrodes, stimulation/recording implantable pulse generators and the potential for remote programming among many other innovations. New therapeutic targets are being assessed for their potential benefits and a surge in the number of deep brain stimulation implantations has given birth to a flourishing scientific literature surrounding the pathophysiology of brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Here we outline the developments of the last decade and look to the future of deep brain stimulation to attempt to discern some of the most promising lines of inquiry in this fast-paced and rapidly evolving field.\n",

            "Mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, are common in women and young girls living with HIV/ AIDS particularly in low- and middle-income (LMICs) countries where women's vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms is heightened due to the prevalent intersectional stressors such as stigma and intimate partner violence. However, no synthesized evidence exists on the mental health burden of females living with HIV/AIDS (FLWHA) in Africa. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the mental health burden among FLWHA in sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic literature review of articles published from 2013-2023 was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). Five electronic databases; PubMed, MEDLINE with full text, Scopus, Academic Search Complete, and Health Source: Nursing Academic Edition were searched for articles published in English. Nineteen articles (15 quantitative, 3 qualitative, and 1 case study) from over 7 African countries met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies' quality was determined to be moderate. The prevalence of depression ranged from 5.9 to 61% and anxiety from 28.9 to 61%. Mental health burden was a logical outcome of HIV diagnosis. Predictors of mental health outcomes in the context of HIV/AIDS were identified as intimate partner violence (IPV), stigma, childhood traumas, sexual abuse, poverty, unemployment, and social isolation. Social support and resilience were identified as protective factors against mental illness in FLWHA. Mental illness had a deleterious effect on viral suppression rates among FLWHA, resulting in delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy treatment and increased mortality but had no impact on immune reconstitution in the face of ART adherence. Given the high prevalence rates of depression and anxiety and their relationship with HIV progression, it is crucial that mental health care services are integrated into routine HIV care.\n",

            "In primary care, 1 million patients have been recruited into NIHR Portfolio studies in the last decade. The top 10% of practices-measured by different studies recruited to-contributed over 50% of that accrual. When the top decile of GP practices is compared to the 20% least active GP practices, research activity is significantly and individually linked with larger GP practices. Furthermore, it is significantly yet modestly associated with GP practice performance (positive patient feedback, Care Quality Commission rating), lower locality deprivation levels, and lower patient to GP ratios.\n",
            "Research activity in GP practices is-as seen previously with hospitals-significantly linked with better GP practice performance and patient feedback. Practice list size and staffing levels in particular interact with the aforementioned. This should be taken into account when determining strategies to increase patient and GP practice participation in NIHR Portfolio research studies.\n",
            "The improper disposal of household pharmaceutical waste (HPW) is an emerging cause of environmental pollution. Behavioural practices are intricately linked to individuals' knowledge levels and attitudes. Thus, this systematic review aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of HPW disposal among the public and to examine the interconnectedness of these KAP components.\n",
            "A literature review for articles published from 2013 to 2023 was carried out in scientific databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying quantitative studies involving the assessment of KAP of the public concerning HPW disposal.\n",
            "This review incorporated 12 studies conducted in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Nine studies highlighted a consistent trend of limited to inadequate knowledge regarding safe medication disposal. Notwithstanding, respondents largely exhibited a positive attitude towards proper medication disposal. This encouraging disposition, unfortunately, stands in stark contrast to the reported practices, which appeared to be inadequate. This dissonance might be due to a deficit in accessible disposal facilities and information, compounded with insufficient guidance from healthcare professionals. Interestingly, the majority expressed support for take-back programs aimed at managing unused and expired medications.\n",
            "This review identified a need for a comprehensive understanding of the interconnected dynamics among KAP components regarding safe medication disposal. The exploration of theoretical behavioural frameworks could help predict public intentions to adopt safe medication disposal practices. Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach that addresses knowledge gaps, reinforces positive attitudes, and promotes accessible safe medication disposal services can collectively safeguard the environment and public health.\n",

            "(1) Background: The first 1000 days of life constitute a critical window of opportunity for microbiota development. Nutrients play a crucial role in enriching and diversifying the microbiota, derived not only from solid food but also from maternal dietary patterns during gestation. (2) Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature review using the PubMed database, covering eleven years (2013-2023). We included English-language reviews, original research papers, and meta-analyses, while excluding case reports and letters. (3) Results: Consensus in the literature emphasizes that our interaction with a multitude of microorganisms begins in the intrauterine environment and continues throughout our lives. The existing data suggest that early nutritional education programs, initiated during pregnancy and guiding infant diets during development, may influence the shaping of the gut microbiota, promoting long-term health. (4) Conclusions: Further research is necessary in the coming years to assess potential interventions and early nutritional models aimed at modulating the pediatric microbiota, especially in vulnerable populations such as premature newborns.\n",
            "Celiac disease (CD) is frequently associated with other autoimmune disorders. Different studies have explored the association between CD and single autoimmune endocrine disease (AED), especially autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) and type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Data about CD as a component of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) are scant. We analyzed a large dataset including prospectively collected data from 920 consecutive adult CD patients diagnosed in a third-level Italian institution in the 2013-2023 period, The prevalence of isolated autoimmune endocrine diseases and APS were collected. A total of 262 (28.5%) CD patients had at least one associated AED, with AIT (n = 223, 24.2%) and T1DM (n = 27, 2.9%) being the most frequent conditions. In most cases (n = 173, 66%), AEDs were diagnosed after CD. Thirteen patients (1.4%) had at least two of the requested three endocrinopathies, satisfying the diagnosis of type 2 APS. APS-2 is a rare but not exceptional occurrence among Italian CD patients, underscoring the intricate and multifaceted nature of autoimmune disorders. Periodic evaluations of thyroid function and glycaemia should be recommended after the diagnosis of CD together with testing for autoantibodies that may be helpful in assessing disease risk before disease onset. Likewise, implementation of a systematic screening for CD amongst T1DM and other autoimmune endocrine diseases are paramount.\n",
            "Breast cancer (BC) constitutes a prevalent health condition among women. Recent years have witnessed the identification of dietary proto-oncogenic factors that deserve attention. Besides the well-known role of alcohol and red and processed meat in BC development, the impact of other dietary components remains unclear. Our narrative review aims to explore the diet-BC relationship, focusing on sugar, dairy, and soy consumption. We conducted a PubMed literature search covering the last decade (2013-2023) and included 35 papers. We found limited evidence on the association between high sugar intake and BC incidence. On the other hand, dairy and soy consumption displayed a protective effect in the majority of the analyzed papers. However, a significant degree of heterogeneity was reported among the results. Menopausal status and the specific BC molecular subtypes were the main factors influencing the interpretation of the results. Exploring dietary factors and BC revealed inconsistencies: high glycemic index post-menopause may be a risk factor, while sugar-sweetened drinks and artificial sweeteners yielded conflicting results; fermented dairy showed potential benefits, non-fermented dairy presented inconsistent findings; soy impact on BC varied according to molecular subtype, with some studies suggesting a positive association in luminal-like BC. Hence, further investigation is crucial to obtain a uniform consensus on the diet-BC relationship.\n",
            "The last decade (2013-2023) has seen unprecedented successes in the clinical translation of therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Eight such molecules have been granted marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) during the decade, after the first ASO drug, fomivirsen, was approved much earlier, in 1998. Splice-modulating ASOs have also been developed for the therapy of inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), due to their ability to redirect aberrant splicing caused by mutations, thus recovering the expression of normal transcripts, and correcting the deficiency of functional proteins. The feasibility of treating IEM patients with splice-switching ASOs has been supported by FDA permission (2018) of the first \"N-of-1\" study of milasen, an investigational ASO drug for Batten disease. Although for IEM, owing to the rarity of individual disease and/or pathogenic mutation, only a low number of patients may be treated by ASOs that specifically suppress the aberrant splicing pattern of mutant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), splice-switching ASOs represent superior individualized molecular therapeutics for IEM. In this work, we first summarize the ASO technology with respect to its mechanisms of action, chemical modifications of nucleotides, and rational design of modified oligonucleotides; following that, we precisely provide a review of the current understanding of developing splice-modulating ASO-based therapeutics for IEM. In the concluding section, we suggest potential ways to improve and/or optimize the development of ASOs targeting IEM.\n",

On laboratory analysis, severe hyponatremia (106 mmol/L and 109 mmol/L) was seen with hyperkalemia and compensated metabolic acidosis. Endocrinological analyses revealed massively increased levels of aldosterone and renin, leading to the diagnosis of type III pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA). A review of the current literature 2013-2023 revealed 26 type III PHA cases aged up to ten months with reduced drinking behavior, weight loss and/or failure to thrive being the most common clinical presentations. Given the severe presentation of PHA electrolyte measurements in infants with urinary tract infections and/or in infants with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are strongly recommended.\n",
            "Telehealth has improved patient access to healthcare services and has been shown to have a positive impact in various healthcare settings. In any case, little is understood regarding the utilization of telehealth in hypertension management in primary healthcare (PHC) settings. This study aimed to identify and classify information about the types of interventions and types of telehealth technology in hypertension management in primary healthcare. A scoping review based on PRISMA-ScR was used in this study. We searched for articles in four databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Embase in English. The selected articles were published in 2013-2023. The data were extracted, categorized, and analyzed using thematic analysis. There were 1142 articles identified and 42 articles included in this study. Regarding the proportions of studies showing varying trends in the last ten years, most studies came from the United States (US) (23.8%), were conducted in urban locations (33.3%), and had a quantitative study approach (69%). Telehealth interventions in hypertension management are dominated by telemonitoring followed by teleconsultation. Asynchronous telehealth is becoming the most widely used technology in managing hypertension in primary care settings. Telehealth in primary care hypertension management involves the use of telecommunications technology to monitor and manage blood pressure and provide medical advice and counselling remotely.\n",

            "A total of 1,427 articles were included in the analysis. In the assessment of HCM, the findings from the past decade have consistently demonstrated a progressive rise in the quantity of articles pertaining to CMR. The country with the largest number of publications was the United States [310], and the institution with the greatest number of publications was the University College London [45]. The analysis of keywords revealed the diagnosis and management of HCM with CMR to be the current research focus and emerging trend within this academic field.\n",
            "This study used a novel approach to visually analyze the use of CMR in HCM assessment. The current research trajectory in CMR consists of the diagnosis and management of patients with HCM. Although most studies confirmed the indispensability of CMR in the assessment of HCM, larger-scale cohorts are still needed to more comprehensively evaluate the role of CMR in the differential diagnosis, pre- and post-treatment assessment, and long-term management of patients with HCM.\n",

            "The escalating prevalence of studies investigating digital addiction (DA) and its detrimental impact on the human brain's structure and functionality has been noticeable in recent years. Yet, an overwhelming majority of these reviews have been predominantly geared towards samples comprising college students or adults and have only inspected a single variant of DA, such as internet gaming disorder, internet addiction disorder, problematic smartphone use, tablet overuse, and so forth. Reviews focusing on young children and adolescents (ages 0-18), or those which amalgamate various types of DA, are decidedly scarce. Given this context, summarizing the effects of DA on brain structure and functionality during the vital developmental stage (0-18 years) is of immense significance. A scoping review, complying with the PRISMA extension for such reviews, was conducted to amalgamate findings from 28 studies spanning a decade (2013-2023) and to examine the influence of assorted forms of DA on the brains of children and adolescents (0-18 years). The synthesized evidence indicated two primary results: (1) DA exerts harmful effects on the structure and functionality of the brains of children and adolescents, and (2) the prefrontal lobe is the region most consistently reported as impacted across all research. Furthermore, this review discerned a notable void of studies investigating the neural indices of digital addiction, along with a shortage of studies focusing on young children (0-6 years old) and longitudinal evidence. This research could provide the necessary theoretical basis for the thwarting and intervention of digital addiction, a measure indispensable for ensuring healthy brain development in children and adolescents.\n",

The treatment arms included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), gastric banding, and MT. The assessed outcomes included body weight loss, diabetes mellitus (DM) remission, changes in dyslipidemia and hypertension markers, and adverse events.\n",
            "Bariatric surgery resulted in significantly better short- and long-term weight loss than MT, with RYGB and SG showing the most substantial reduction. The DM remission rates were notably higher in the surgery group, with marked improvements in hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels. Improvements in dyslipidemia were inconclusive, whereas hypertension showed modest improvements, particularly with RYGB. Complication rates varied, with RYGB reporting higher rates of early complications, and SG reporting increased rates of late complications. The perioperative reoperation rates were low across all surgical treatments. Specific adverse events, such as intestinal obstruction and anastomosis site problems, were more common in the RYGB group, whereas reflux symptoms were more common in the SG group.\n",
            "Bariatric surgery, especially RYGB and SG, provided superior weight loss and DM remission outcomes compared to MT, although with varied complication profiles. These findings underscore the need for careful patient selection and postoperative management in bariatric surgery. Future studies should aim to refine these processes to improve patient outcomes.\n",

            "Seven cases of MS-associated uveitis were retrieved from our databases. There were five females and two males. The diagnosis of MS was made by the neurologist in all cases. Bilaterality was seen in all cases. Intermediate uveitis was the most common presentation (five cases). It was associated with peripheral retinal vasculitis (two cases) and disc pallor (two cases). Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (one case) and incomplete Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH)-like presentation with a peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane (one case) were the other presentations. In the case with incomplete VKH-like presentation, whole genome sequencing revealed a heterozygous non-synonymous variation (c.1228C>T) in exon 10 of TNFRSF1A, suggestive of susceptibility to multiple sclerosis 5 due to mutation in the TNFRS1A gene on chromosome 12p13.31. All cases received systemic steroids. Azathioprine (three cases) and rituximab (three cases) were the commonly used immunomodulatory drugs.

            "Phototherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are ultraviolet light (UV) based therapies for patients with skin diseases, and are sometimes associated with potential adverse events (AE)s, including erythema, pain, pruritus, burns, and photoaging.\n",
            "We investigated UV phototherapy and PDT safety using the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The MAUDE database, including medical device reports (MDR)s informed by voluntary and obligatory reporters since 1991, was searched for AEs associated with UV phototherapy and PDT 1/1/91-3/1/23.\n",
            "There were 59 UV phototherapy and 33 PDT related MDRs. Burns were the most common AE type for both phototherapy and PDT. The majority of phototherapy AEs occurred during 2021 (52.3%), and were significantly more likely to occur at home than in the clinic. Overall, 76.1% of MDRs associated with home light boxes were prescribed by online retailers, most of the MDRs (59.3%) mentioned that it is prohibited to sell phototherapy devices not prescribed by physicians, and only 8.5% noted poorly written home light box instructions.\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic prohibited in-person light treatments, and social distancing requirements may have resulted in increased frequency of home-based light treatments. Hence, while at home treatment may be easier and more accessible, in-office physician supervised UV treatments are associated with less frequent AEs. Moreover, some phototherapy MDRs reported poorly written instructions accompanying the home light box, and some PDT MDRs documented patients receiving inadequate education regarding the procedure. With the rise of at-home treatment options and the ease of obtaining devices on the internet, it is physicians' duty to advise patients against self-treating with home light boxes without prescribed treatment regimens and educate patients that are considering home phototherapy to ensure safer patient experiences.\n",
            "The tumor suppressor p53 (p53) is regulated by murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) and its homologous MdmX in maintaining the basal level of p53. Overexpressed Mdm2/MdmX inhibits cellular p53 activity, which is highly relevant to cancer occurrence. Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 106 (CCDC106) has been identified as a p53-interacting partner. However, the molecular mechanism of the p53/Mdm2/MdmX/CCDC106 interactions is still elusive. Here, we show that CCDC106 functions as a signaling regulator of the p53-Mdm2/MdmX axis. We identified that CCDC106 directly interacts with the p53 transactivation domain by competing with Mdm2 and MdmX. CCDC106 overexpression downregulates the cellular level of p53 and Mdm2/MdmX, and decreased p53 reversibly downregulates the cellular level of CCDC106. Our work provides a molecular mechanism by which CCDC106 regulates the cellular levels of p53 and Mdm2/MdmX.\n",
            "It is necessary to re-imagine nursing curriculums utilizing a postmodern approach, as outdated teacher-centred methods of nursing education with emphasis on memorization versus critical thinking no longer meet the needs of the contemporary learner and the current challenges of the healthcare environment. There is an explicit need to redesign nursing curriculums that are future-oriented, adaptive and flexible and serve the learners' best interests.\n",
            "Distilled from a decade of teaching experience in an undergraduate, second-degree entry, accelerated nursing program, this paper describes the construction of a learner-centred, postmodern, concept-based nursing curriculum that aims to foster learners' inquiry skills, critical thinking, problem-solving, and experiential learning-all which develop learners' autonomy, self-direction, and lifelong learning. The objective is to foster learners' transformational and emancipatory learning and metacognition.\n",
            "An extensive review of the current trends, contemporary nursing knowledge for the past decade (2013-2023), and seminal literature on theories and frameworks paralleled with the review of current and future trends in Canadian and global health care, including the socio-economic, politico and environmental contexts, led to the formulation of a concept-based curriculum. Grounded in the constructivist paradigm, the curriculum applies interperetivist, critical, feminist, and indigenous lenses. The Strength-Based Nursing framework was selected as the core guiding framework. The curriculum's four curricular themes and foundational pillars were adopted directly from the framework to provide a starting point for concept development. These initial themes were then juxtaposed with relevant nursing, and social theories, policies, and frameworks, ensuring a robust coverage of modern nursing knowledge and allowing for the core concepts of the curriculum to emerge. A total of 21 concepts and 192 sub-concepts were developed.\n",

            "Exposure to radon can impact human health. This is a nonsystematic review of articles written in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese published in the last decade (2013-2023), using databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and SciELO. Search terms selected were radon, human health, respiratory diseases, children, and adults. After analyzing the titles and abstracts, the researchers initially identified 47 studies, which were subsequently reduced to 40 after excluding reviews, dissertations, theses, and case-control studies. The studies have shown that enclosed environments such as residences and workplaces have higher levels of radon than those outdoors. Moreover, radon is one of the leading causes of lung cancer, especially in nonsmokers. An association between exposure to radon and development of other lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, was also observed. It is crucial to increase public awareness and implement governmental control measures to reduce radon exposure. It is essential to quantify radon levels in all types of buildings and train professionals to conduct such measurements according to proven efficacy standards. Health care professionals should also be informed about this threat and receive adequate training to deal with the effects of radon on human health.\n",

Após a análise dos títulos e resumos, os pesquisadores inicialmente identificaram 47 estudos, que foram posteriormente reduzidos para 40 após a exclusão de revisões, dissertações, teses e estudos de caso-controle. Os estudos mostraram que ambientes fechados como residências e locais de trabalho apresentam maiores níveis de radônio do que ambientes externos. Além disso, o radônio é uma das principais causas de câncer de pulmão, especialmente em não fumates. Também foi observada associação entre exposição ao radônio e desenvolvimento de outras doenças pulmonares, como asma e DPOC. É crucial aumentar a conscientização do público e implementar medidas governamentais de controle para reduzir a exposição ao radônio. É fundamental quantificar os níveis de radônio em todos os tipos de edifícios e treinar profissionais para realizar essas medições segundo padrões de eficácia comprovada.

The prognosis of HFpEF is comparable with that of HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), and, regardless of the type, HF is associated with five-year mortality of 50-75%. The antiarrhythmic properties of BBs are wellrecognized, and BBs as a class of drugs are - in general - recommended to decrease the incidence of AF in HTN.\n",
            "BBs are recommended (as a class) for AF prevention in several contemporary guidelines for HTN. LVH regression in HTN - used as a single criterion for the choice of antihypertensive medication - does not capture this protective effect. Consequently, it is worth studying how meaningful this antiarrhythmic action (to prevent AF) of BBs is in patients with HTN LVH in addition to a RAAS blocker.\n",

In these encounters, culture is described as mainly related to the child, whereas the health professionals' understanding of their own culture as impacting the encounter tends to be left out. To clarify how culture is understood and conceptualised among professionals, it is of relevance to collate previous research on health professionals' understanding of culture. In the scoping review that this protocol describes, we aim to focus on the context of the school health services, being a context accessible to many children in their everyday life. The aim of the review will be to identify, describe and analyse previous research concerning school health professionals' (ie, school nurses, school social workers, school doctors and school psychologists) understanding of culture.\n",

            "Inflammation is the human body's defence process against various pathogens, toxic substances, irradiation, and physically injured cells that have been damaged. Inflammation is characterized by swelling, pain, redness, heat, as well as diminished tissue function. Multiple important inflammatory markers determine the prognosis of inflammatory processes, which include likes of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are controlled by nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, all of which are activated in response to the stimulation of specific receptors. Besides these, the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme family also plays a significant role in inflammation. The current review is kept forth to compile a summary of small molecules-based drugs approved by the USFDA during the study period of 2013-2023. A thorough discussion has also been made to focus on biologics, macromolecules, and small chemical entities approved during this study period and their greener synthetic routes with a brief discussion on the chemical spacing parameters of anti-inflammatory drugs.

Overall, there were 4151 research articles, after screening only 17 articles with 39,906 patients were included. Conclusion: Elderly patients with breast cancer should be treated differently in an adapted way. The treatment should not be the same worldwide due to different health systems. Molecular surrogates are different in geriatric patients. Surgery is the best option for treatment in this subset of patients. We need to have therapeutic decision appointments for elderly patients with breast cancer. The guidelines and medical authority should be used in the best decision.\n",

The most thoroughly investigated (sub)specialties were Colorectal (6 SRs, 25 MAs), OG (9 SRs, 15 MAs), and HPB (4 SRs, 12 MAs). Interestingly, there was high heterogeneity regarding the administered ICG doses, routes, and timing. The use of ICG offered a clear benefit regarding anastomotic leak prevention, particularly after colorectal and esophageal surgery. There was no clear benefit regarding sentinel node detection after OG. According to the AMSTAR 2 tool, most meta-analyses ranked as \"critically low\" (34.7%) or \"low\" (58.7%) quality. There were only five meta-analyses (6.7%) that qualified as \"moderate\" quality, whereas there were no \"high\" quality reviews.\n",
            "Regardless of the abundance of pertinent literature and reviews, surgeons should be cautious when interpreting their results on ICG use in abdominal surgery. Future reviews should focus on ensuring methodological vigor; establishing clear protocols of ICG dose, route of administration, and timing; and improving reporting quality. Other sources of data (e.g., registries) and novel methods of data analysis (e.g., machine learning) might also contribute to an enhanced role of ICG as a decision-making tool in surgery.\n",

The Chattogram Metropolitan Area (CMA) has been going through rapid urbanization, which has impacted the LULC transformation and accelerated the growth of urban sprawl and unplanned development. To map those urban sprawls and natural resources depletion, this study aims to monitor the LULC change using Landsat satellite imagery from 2003 to 2023 in the cloud-based remote sensing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). LULC has been classified into five distinct classes: waterbody, build-up, bare land, dense vegetation, and cropland, employing four machine learning algorithms (random forest, gradient tree boost, classification & regression tree, and support vector machine) in the GEE platform. The overall accuracy (kappa statistics) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve have demonstrated satisfactory results. The results indicate that the CART model outperforms other LULC models when considering efficiency and accuracy in the designated study region. The analysis of LULC conversions revealed notable trends, patterns, and magnitudes across all periods: 2003-2013, 2013-2023, and 2003-2023. The expansion of unregulated built-up areas and the decline of croplands emerged as primary concerns. However, there was a positive indication of a significant increase in dense vegetation within the study area over the 20 years.\n",
            "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuroinflammation linked to amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation and phosphorylated tau (τ) protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Key elements in Aβ production and NFT assembly, like γ-secretase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), contribute to neuroinflammation. In addition, impaired proteosomal and autophagic pathways increase Aβ and τ aggregation, leading to neuronal damage. Conventional neuroinflammation drugs have limitations due to unidirectional therapeutic approaches and challenges in crossing the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). Clinical trials for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other therapeutics remain uncertain. Novel strategies addressing the complex pathogenesis and BBB translocation are needed to effectively tackle AD-related neuroinflammation.\n",

We sought to contrast statin prescription patterns between DM/PM-HLD and RA-HLD patients and delve into the mortality variations among DM/PM-HLD statin users and non-users.\n",
            "We examined a decade's worth of anonymized US health data from the TriNetX database. Inclusion criteria were a subsequent HLD diagnosis after an initial DM/PM or RA diagnosis. We compared statin initiation rates and mortality outcomes, adjusting for demographics and cardiovascular risks through propensity score matching.\n",
            "The analysis comprised 33,000 RA-HLD and 1079 DM/PM-HLD patients. RA-HLD patients exhibited higher statin initiation (27.4%) than DM/PM-HLD patients (17.91%, p < 0.0001). Notably, DM/PM-HLD statin users (n = 311) presented a reduced mortality rate (75 deaths/1000/year) compared to non-users (n = 661) with 147 deaths/1000/year (p = 0.0273, HR = 0.515, CI 0.28-0.93).\n",
            "There is a marked disparity in statin initiation between DM/PM-HLD and RA-HLD patients, accompanied by elevated mortality in DM/PM-HLD non-users. It is imperative for further research to elucidate this discrepancy and formulate patient-centric cardiovascular guidelines for DM/PM-HLD patients. Key Points • Statin initiation among patients with DM/PM-HLD is significantly lower than that with RA-HLD. • Mortality rates within the statin initiator DM/PM-HLD were significantly lower compared to non-statin DM/PM-HLD initiators, spanning multiple time intervals.\n",
            "While a congestive heart failure patient will ultimately need an assist device or even a replacement heart as the disease progresses, not every patient is qualified for such advanced therapy. Such patients awaiting better circulatory support benefit from positive inotropes in the meantime as palliative care. These agents are often prescribed in patients with acute decompensated heart failure, with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and symptoms of organ dysfunction. Although positive inotropes, for example, digoxin, dobutamine, milrinone, levosimendan, etc., are successfully marketed and in use, a lot of their adverse effects, like arrhythmias, hypotension, and even sudden cardiac death, are rather encouraging further research on the development of novel positive inotropes. This review has investigated the molecular mechanisms of some of these adverse effects in terms of the proteins they target, followed by research on newer targets. Studies from 2013-2023 that have reported new small molecules with positive inotropic effects have been revisited in order to determine the progress made so far in drug discovery.\n",
            "The interest of scientists in the carbazole core has risen steadily over the last 30 years, particularly over the last decade given its presence in several active pharmaceutical ingredients, functional materials and a wide range of biologically active natural products. The continuous development of more efficient, more (regio-)selective and \"greener\" methodologies to access the carbazole core is thus imperative. This review compares and evaluates synthetic strategies towards the carbazole core that have been reported since 2013, with a focus on their applicability towards the total synthesis of carbazole-containing natural products.\n",
            "Aged rice (AR) was mildly heated in aqueous dispersions containing different amounts of xanthan gum (Xan) at 60 °C for 1 h, and then dried in a humidity chamber (50 °C, 80% RH) for 12 h. The AR kernels treated without Xan showed a coarse surface with many pores after cooking, whereas the same rice treated with Xan showed a smooth and uniform surface. Prior to the treatment, the cooked AR was harder and less sticky than the cooked fresh rice (FR). The hydrothermal treatment softened the cooked AR although did not change its adhesiveness. The same treatment in the presence of Xan could increase the adhesiveness of AR, making the textural characteristics of AR similar to those of FR. Sensory evaluation revealed that the mild heat treatment in the presence of Xan restored the eating quality and acceptability of cooked AR which had been lost by aging.\n",

            "Chronic diseases are potential risk factors for pregnancy duration and neonatal outcomes. This narrative review aimed to summarize the research results on the specifics of pregnancy in women with obesity and after bariatric surgery. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, and references to identified articles from the last ten years (2013-2023) were included. Ultimately, 107 literature items were qualified. It has been shown that women with obesity planning pregnancy should reduce their body weight because obesity is a risk factor for adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Bariatric surgery effectively reduces excessive body weight and the health risks in women with obesity during pregnancy and their offspring. However, at least a year interval between surgery and conception is recommended. An interdisciplinary medical team should provide patient care during pregnancy with knowledge and skills related to people after bariatric surgery. Due to the increased risk of mental disorders, especially depression, it is necessary to constantly monitor the mental state of women and provide psychological support and education on a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and the postpartum period.\n",

            "Eligible studies were those considering PHPT exclusively in the older population (main databases: PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar and the University Online database). Articles published in the last 10 years (2013-2023) were considered. Eligibility criteria followed the SPIDER (sample, phenomenon of interest, design, evaluation, research type) tool. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. A total of 29 studies (mainly observational) matched the inclusion criteria.\n",
            "The prevalence of PHPT is approximately 1 per 100 in the elderly, and it is more common in females. The clinical presentation varies by age and can include osteoporosis, fractures, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conservative management can be an option whenever surgery is not indicated or feasible. However, parathyroidectomy (PTX) remains a safe and effective modality in aging populations with improvement to symptoms, bone mineral density, fracture risk, frailty, quality of life, and metabolic derangements. Complication rates are similar in elderly people compared to younger ones, except for mildly longer length of hospital stay and reoperation for those with higher frailty.\n",

            "Violence against healthcare workers recently became a growing public health concern and has been intensively investigated, particularly in the tertiary setting. Nevertheless, little is known of workplace violence against healthcare workers in the primary setting. Given the nature of primary healthcare, which delivers essential healthcare services to the community, many primary healthcare workers are vulnerable to violent events. Since the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, the number of epidemiological studies on workplace violence against primary healthcare workers has increased globally. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review summarising the significant results from previous studies has not been published. Thus, this systematic review was conducted to collect and analyse recent evidence from previous workplace violence studies in primary healthcare settings. Eligible articles published in 2013-2023 were searched from the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed literature databases. Of 23 included studies, 16 were quantitative, four were qualitative, and three were mixed method. The extracted information was analysed and grouped into four main themes: prevalence and typology, predisposing factors, implications, and coping mechanisms or preventive measures. The prevalence of violence ranged from 45.6% to 90%. The most commonly reported form of violence was verbal abuse (46.9-90.3%), while the least commonly reported was sexual assault (2-17%). Most primary healthcare workers were at higher risk of patient- and family-perpetrated violence (Type II). Three sub-themes of predisposing factors were identified: individual factors (victims' and perpetrators' characteristics), community or geographical factors, and workplace factors. There were considerable negative consequences of violence on both the victims and organisations. Under-reporting remained the key issue, which was mainly due to the negative perception of the effectiveness of existing workplace policies for managing violence. Workplace violence is a complex issue that indicates a need for more serious consideration of a resolution on par with that in other healthcare settings. Several research gaps and limitations require additional rigorous analytical and interventional research. Information pertaining to violent events must be comprehensively collected to delineate the complete scope of the issue and formulate prevention strategies based on potentially modifiable risk factors to minimise the negative implications caused by workplace violence.\n",
            "Filgotinib is an orally administered, preferential Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The short-term safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with filgotinib from Phase 2b/3 clinical trials (DARWIN 1 and 2; FINCH 1, 2, and 3) are described in patients who inadequately responded to methotrexate (MTX) and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or who were naïve to MTX. This article reviews the safety and efficacy from the long-term extension (LTE) trials, DARWIN 3 (N=739) and FINCH 4 (N=2731), and PROs across the filgotinib development program in RA. Overall, in the DARWIN clinical trials (conducted from 2013-2023), patients received their LTE treatment for ≤8 years, while in the FINCH trials (ongoing from 2016-2025), patients received filgotinib treatment for ≤6 years in the LTE. The longer-term safety profile and consistent, sustained efficacy (American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70, Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Disease Activity Scale in 28 joints with C-reactive protein response rates) of filgotinib were largely similar to those observed in the shorter-term parent trials ≤52 weeks. PRO results from the parent trials showed improvements in patients' quality of life with filgotinib treatment, which compared to or exceeded improvements seen with placebo and active comparators (adalimumab, MTX). Filgotinib has a higher specificity for JAK1 compared with other therapeutic treatments, leading to reduced inhibition of JAK2/3-dependent pathways, potentially providing a distinct safety profile. Filgotinib is approved in Europe and Japan for treatment of people with moderate-to-severe RA, though it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, due to concerns around the benefit/risk profile of the filgotinib 200-mg dosage and the potential impact on semen parameters.\n",

            "It is not widely recognized that iron (ferrous sulfate) pill aspiration causes airway damage. Clinical diagnosis is challenging because patients are often unaware that they have aspirated a pill. The literature on this entity consists mainly of case reports. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical and pathologic features of iron pill aspiration in a series of 11 patients. A retrospective review of our pathology archives was performed to identify cases of iron pill aspiration (2013-2023). All available histologic and cytologic material was rereviewed. Clinical information was collected from the electronic medical record, and imaging studies were rereviewed. Eighteen endobronchial biopsies were identified from 11 patients (7 women and 4 men; mean age, 70 years; range, 44-82 years). Eight patients had corresponding cytology (20 specimens). Medication history was available in 9 of 11 patients, all of whom were taking iron sulfate pills. Two patients reported possible aspiration episodes; 4 had risk factors for aspiration. The diagnosis of iron pill aspiration was suspected prior to biopsy in only 1 case. Histologically, iron pill particles were yellow, golden brown, or gray, were elongated and crystal or fiber like, and stained strongly with an iron stain. Common histologic findings included mucosal ulceration, acute and/or chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and squamous metaplasia. Iron pill particles were also identified in 11 cytology specimens from 6 patients. On Papanicolaou staining, iron pill particles were yellow to golden, fiber like, refractile, and crystalline. Reactive epithelial cells, squamous metaplasia, and acute inflammation were common. The combination of iron pill intake and discolored mucosa on bronchoscopy is a potential clue to the diagnosis of iron pill aspiration. Pathologists should familiarize themselves with the appearance of iron pill particles in endobronchial biopsies and cytology specimens from the respiratory tract as this diagnosis is seldom suspected on clinical grounds, and most patients lack a history of aspiration.\n",

However, the methodological and reporting quality of these MAs has not yet been fully evaluated so far. Therefore, the present study evaluated the quality of these MAs through a methodological systematic review. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception until May 20, 2022, and PubMed was used to update the search until September 6, 2023. The methodological and reporting quality of the selected MAs was evaluated using AMSTAR-2 and PRISMA 2009. Fifty-one MAs published during 2013-2023 were included. In each review, the number of primary studies ranged from 3 to 37, and the number of participants ranged from 50 to 2114. Among the first-listed primary outcomes, only 23 (45.10%) were \"positive.\" As for the methodological quality, most MAs (44, 86.27%) on resveratrol were rated critically low. Inadequate reporting of the included MAs mainly involved items 2 (\"Structured summary\"), 5 (\"Protocol and registration\"), 8 (\"Search\"), 9 (\"Study selection\"), 10 (\"Data collection process\"), 12 (\"Risk of bias in individual studies\"), and 24 (\"Summary of evidence\") based on the PRISMA 2009.

            "Antibiotic resistance associated with various microorganisms such as Gram-positive, Gram-negative, fungal strains, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis increases the risk of healthcare survival. Preliminary therapeutics becoming ineffective that might lead to noteworthy mortality presents a crucial challenge for the scientific community. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop hybrid compounds as antimicrobial agents by combining two or more bioactive heterocyclic moieties into a single molecular framework with fewer side effects and a unique mode of action. This review highlights the recent advances (2013-2023) in the pharmacology of rhodanine-linked quinoline hybrids as more effective antimicrobial agents. In the drug development process, linker hybrids acquire the top position due to their excellent π-stacking and Van der Waals interaction with the DNA active sites of pathogens. A molecular hybridization strategy has been optimized, indicating that combining these two bioactive moieties with an arylidene and an amino spacer linker increases the antimicrobial potential and reduces drug resistance. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship study is discussed to express the role of various functional groups in improving and decrementing antimicrobial activities for rational drug design. Also, a linker approach may accelerate the development of dynamic antimicrobial agents through molecular hybridization.\n",
            "Uncertainty estimation in healthcare involves quantifying and understanding the inherent uncertainty or variability associated with medical predictions, diagnoses, and treatment outcomes. In this era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, uncertainty estimation becomes vital to ensure safe decision-making in the medical field. Therefore, this review focuses on the application of uncertainty techniques to machine and deep learning models in healthcare. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our analysis revealed that Bayesian methods were the predominant technique for uncertainty quantification in machine learning models, with Fuzzy systems being the second most used approach. Regarding deep learning models, Bayesian methods emerged as the most prevalent approach, finding application in nearly all aspects of medical imaging. Most of the studies reported in this paper focused on medical images, highlighting the prevalent application of uncertainty quantification techniques using deep learning models compared to machine learning models. Interestingly, we observed a scarcity of studies applying uncertainty quantification to physiological signals. Thus, future research on uncertainty quantification should prioritize investigating the application of these techniques to physiological signals. Overall, our review highlights the significance of integrating uncertainty techniques in healthcare applications of machine learning and deep learning models. This can provide valuable insights and practical solutions to manage uncertainty in real-world medical data, ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of medical diagnoses and treatment recommendations.\n",
            "In 2022 the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) published Clinical Protocol #36: The Mastitis Spectrum, which aims to update clinical approaches to management of benign lactation-related breast inflammation.

This Commentary aims to continue respectful debate amongst clinicians and researchers within the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine and more broadly, confident that we share a fundamental commitment to promote breastfeeding and support the well-being of lactating women, their infants and their families.\n",
            "Although Clinical Protocol #36 offers advances, it does not fulfil the principles of best practice implementation science for translation of evidence into clinical guidelines. Clinical Protocol #36 inaccurately represents studies; misrepresents theoretical models as proven aetiologies; does not consistently attribute sources; does not reliably apply the SORT taxonomy; and relies upon single case reports. As a result, various recommendations in Clinical Protocol #36 lack an evidence-base or credible underlying theoretical model. This includes recommendations to use 'lymphatic drainage' massage, therapeutic ultrasound, and oral lecithin. Similarly, based on a contestable theoretical model which is presented as fact, Clinical Protocol #36 makes the recommendation to either reduce frequency of milk removal or to maintain current frequency of milk removal during an episode of breast inflammation. Although Clinical Protocol #36 limits this advice to cases of 'hyperlactation', the diagnosis 'hyperlactation' itself is undefinable. As a result, this recommendation may put breastfeeding women who present with breast inflammation at risk of worsened inflammation and decreased breast milk production.\n",
            "Clinical Protocol #36 offers some advances in the management of breast inflammation. However, Clinical Protocol #36 also exposes clinicians to two international trends in healthcare which undermine health system sustainability: overdiagnosis, including by over-definition, which increases risk of overtreatment; and antibiotic over-use, which worsens the crisis of global antimicrobial resistance. Clinical Protocol #36 also recommends unnecessary or ineffective interventions which may be accessed by affluent patients within advanced economies but are difficult to access for the global majority. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine may benefit from a review of processes for development of Clinical Protocols.\n",
            "Pediatric renal diseases vary widely and are linked to high morbidity and mortality; hence, early diagnosis is vital. Presently, genetic testing is being incorporated into the standard of care for children and their families with kidney disease, primarily as a diagnostic tool. In the present review, we aim to collect all potential evidence from relevant studies that reported the role of genetic testing in pediatric renal disease diagnostic, prognostic, and social implications. We have conducted both electronic and manual searches within PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus to find relevant studies. Studies from the years 2013-2023 were included. Case reports with limited sample sizes and no descriptive statistics, along with review papers and meta-analyses, were excluded from this review. Quality assessment for all included studies was performed. The pooled diagnostic yields were calculated using the common effect and random effect models utilizing the R program (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The pooled result for the diagnostic yield as per the common effect model is a pooled proportion of 0.42 (42%) 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.39,0.44], while with the random effects model the pooled proportion is 0.43 (43%) 95% CI: [0.31,0.57]. The diagnostic yield for the included studies ranged from 78.10% to 16.8%. The spectrum of kidney diseases included nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, glomerular diseases, cystic kidney disease, ciliopathies, tubulopathies, chronic kidney disease, and congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tracts (CAKUT), while hematuria and proteinuria were reported by two studies and autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant idiopathic kidney disease was reported by only one study. Genetic testing validates clinical diagnosis and aids in tailoring management strategies; hence, a more precise treatment plan is developed and unnecessary investigations are avoided, which is crucial in the case of children during routine nephrology clinic visits. Genetic counselling is of the utmost importance, so all ethical and social concerns related to genetic testing are addressed in addition to patient satisfaction.\n",
            "Despite modern radiotherapy (RT) techniques, radiation-induced proctitis (RIP) remains a significant complication of RT for pelvic organ malignancies. Over the last decades, an enormous therapeutic armamentarium has been considered in RIP, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). However, the evidence regarding the impact of HBOT on RIP is conflicting. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HBOT in the treatment of RIP.\n",
            "Ten-year (2013-2023) retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with RIP treated with HBOT at Centro de Medicina Subaquática e Hiperbárica (CMSH) (Armed Forces Hospital - Lisbon, Portugal). Patients were exposed to 100% oxygen at 2.5 ATA, in a multiplace first-class hyperbaric chamber, for 70-min periods, once daily, five times per week. Fisher's exact test was performed using SPSS (version 23.0); p<0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.\n",
            "Of a total of 151 patients with RIP, 88 were included in the final analysis, of whom 38.6% evidenced other concurrent radiation-induced soft tissue lesions. The most reported primary pelvic tumor treated with RT was prostate cancer (77.3%), followed by cervical cancer (10.2%). Hematochezia was the most observed clinical manifestation (86.4%). After a median of 60 HBOT sessions (interquartile range [IQR]: 40-87.5), 62.5% and 31.8% of patients achieved a clinical complete and partial response, respectively, with a hematochezia resolution rate of 93.7% (complete or partial). While partial and complete responses require fewer than 70 sessions of HBOT in terms of overall RIP symptoms (p=0.069), isolated hematochezia tends to require at least 70 sessions (p=0.075). Individuals with at least two concurrent late radiation tissue injuries were associated with a complete response to HBOT (p=0.029). Only about 5.7% of patients did not respond to the treatment. Eighteen patients (20.5%) developed reversible ear barotrauma. The number of HBOT sessions was a predictor of HBOT side effects (odds ratio: 1.010; 95% confidence interval, 1.000-1.020; p=0.047).\n",
            "The HBOT proved to be an effective and safe treatment for RIP refractory to medical and/or endoscopic treatments. This real-world evidence study adds value to published data on the management of RIP with HBOT.\n",
            "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a well-recognized global threat. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report ranking the critical types of bacterial resistance that need to be monitored. Several studies from individual institutions in Saudi Arabia have reported rates of antimicrobial resistance using automated methods. However, no national surveillance study has been conducted to date using gold standard methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This review summarizes AMR rates for major bacterial pathogens in Saudi Arabia and provides a justification for the need for a national surveillance project. In Saudi Arabia, AMR rates for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are on the rise. Surveillance studies help identify AMR trends and emergence of outbreaks. The WHO has started a program, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), encouraging its member states, including Saudi Arabia, to conduct antimicrobial surveillance studies to estimate AMR rates worldwide. Of the microbiological methods used to test antimicrobial susceptibility, only broth microdilution (BMD) is considered the \"gold standard.\" As AMR studies in Saudi Arabia are sparse, mostly limited to single centers and were conducted using automated methods, a national AMR surveillance project is needed to evaluate the current status and to inform stewardship decisions.\n",

            "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are identifiable members of proteolytic enzymes that can degrade a wide range of proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs can be categorized into six groups based on their substrate specificity and structural differences: collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, metalloelastase, and membrane-type MMPs. MMPs have been linked to a wide variety of biological processes, such as cell transformation and carcinogenesis. Over time, MMPs have been evaluated for their role in cancer progression, migration, and metastasis. Accordingly, various MMPs have become attractive therapeutic targets for anticancer drug development. The first generations of broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors displayed effective inhibitory activities but failed in clinical trials due to poor selectivity. Thanks to the evolution of X-ray crystallography, NMR analysis, and homology modeling studies, it has been possible to characterize the active sites of various MMPs and, consequently, to develop more selective, second-generation MMP inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the computational and synthesis approaches used in the development of MMP inhibitors and their evaluation as potential anticancer agents.\n",
            "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an oxidative stress-linked neurodegenerative disease, leads to irreversible damage of the central retina and severe visual impairment. Advanced age and the long-standing influence of oxidative stress and oxidative cellular damage play crucial roles in AMD etiopathogenesis. Many authors emphasize the role of heterophagy, autophagy, and mitophagy in maintaining homeostasis in the retina. Relevantly modifying the activity of both macroautophagy and mitophagy pathways represents one of the new therapeutic strategies in AMD. Our review provides an overview of the antioxidative roles of heterophagy, autophagy, and mitophagy and presents associations between dysregulations of these molecular mechanisms and AMD etiopathogenesis. The authors performed an extensive analysis of the literature, employing PubMed and Google Scholar, complying with the 2013-2023 period, and using the following keywords: age-related macular degeneration, RPE cells, reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, heterophagy, autophagy, and mitophagy. Heterophagy, autophagy, and mitophagy play antioxidative roles in the retina; however, they become sluggish and dysregulated with age and contribute to AMD development and progression. In the retina, antioxidative roles also play in RPE cells, NFE2L2 and PGC-1α proteins, NFE2L2/PGC-1α/ARE signaling cascade, Nrf2 factor, p62/SQSTM1/Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway, circulating miRNAs, and Yttrium oxide nanoparticles performed experimentally in animal studies.\n",

            "In 2012 the European Medicines Agency approved a pineapple stem-derived Bromelain-based debridement concentrate of proteolytic enzymes (NexoBrid®, MediWound Ltd, Yavne, Israel) for adult deep burns. Over 10 000 patients have been successfully treated with NexoBrid® globally, including in the US. The aim of our study is to perform a systematic review of the current literature on Nexobrid® outcomes. We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and other search engines (2013-2023). The online screening process was performed by two independent reviewers with the Covidence tool. The protocol was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses, and it was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews of the National Institute for Health Research. We identified 103 relevant studies of which 34 were found eligible. The included studies report the positive effects of Nexobrid® on burn debridement, functional and cosmetic outcomes, scarring, and quality of life. Also, they validate the high patient satisfaction thanks to enhanced protocols of analgosedation and/or locoregional anaesthesia during Bromelain-based debridement. Two studies investigate potential risks (coagulopathy, burn wound infection) which concluded there is no strong evidence of these adverse events. NexoBrid® is a safe, selective, non-surgical eschar removal treatment modality. The benefits of Bromelain-based debridement are faster debridement and healing times, reduced operations, length of stay, cases of sepsis, blood transfusions, and prevention of compartment syndrome. Existing evidence suggests that the indications and the role of Bromelain-based debridement are expanding to cover \"off-label\" cases with significant benefits to the global healthcare economy.\n",
            "Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) is characterized by bilateral benign adrenocortical lesions, which in some cases lead to Cushing syndrome (CS). Due to the low detection, non-specific, erased clinical picture and slow, long-term progression, it is difficult to assess the true prevalence of PBMAH. This also leads to fairly limited literature data. A detailed analysis of biochemical, imaging parameters, the clinical presentations, in particular, an assessment of the course of comorbidities (arterial hypertension (AH), diabetes (DM), osteoporosis), is necessary to develop an algorithm for managing patients with PBMAH.\n",

            "A single-centre longitudinal seroprevalence vaccine response study was conducted with 280 LCTF participants (median 82 yrs, IQR 76-88 yrs; 95.4% male). Screening by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction with weekly asymptomatic/symptomatic testing (March 2020-October 2021) and serology pre-/post-two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination for (i) anti-nucleocapsid, (ii) quantified anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies at three time-intervals, (iii) pseudovirus neutralisation, and (iv) inhibition by anti-RBD competitive ELISA were conducted. Neutralisation activity: antibody titre relationship was assessed via beta linear-log regression and RBD antibody-binding inhibition: post-vaccine infection relationship by Wilcoxon rank sum test.\n",
            "Here we show neutralising antibody titres are 9.2-fold (95% CI 5.8-14.5) higher associated with hybrid immunity (p < 0.00001); +7.5-fold (95% CI 4.6-12.1) with asymptomatic infection; +20.3-fold, 95% (CI 9.7-42.5) with symptomatic infection. A strong association is observed between antibody titre: neutralising activity (p < 0.00001) and rising anti-RBD antibody titre: RBD antibody-binding inhibition (p < 0.001), although 18/169 (10.7%) participants with high anti-RBD titre (>100BAU/ml), show inhibition <75%. Higher RBD antibody-binding inhibition values are associated with hybrid immunity and reduced likelihood of infection (p = 0.003).\n",
            "Hybrid immunity in older adults was associated with considerably higher antibody titres, neutralisation and inhibition capacity. Instances of high anti-RBD titre with lower inhibition suggests antibody quantity and quality as independent potential correlates of protection, highlighting added value of measuring inhibition over antibody titre alone to inform vaccine strategy.\n",

We investigated the effect of infection and vaccination on antibody development and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults. Antibodies are proteins that the immune system produces on infection or vaccination that can help respond to subsequent infection with SARS-CoV-2. We found that older adults produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after 2-doses of Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The strongest immune responses were seen among those older adults who also had prior history of infection. The results highlight the importance of both antibody quality and quantity when considering possible indicators of protection against COVID-19 and supports the need for a third, booster, vaccination in this age group..\n",

            "The present manuscript focuses on the challenges regarding the patenting process of CAR-T technology, beginning with a description of the main characteristics of CAR-T cells and their functionalities, continuing with the legal landscape applicable to patenting processes, and concluding by presenting the potential strategies to overcome the impediments that can appear when trying to patent CAR-T cells. It is meant to offer insights for those who are exploring possible patenting options in CAR-T cells territory. PubMed and Patenscope databases were used for patent and literature searching (2013-2023).\n",
            "There is no one-size-fits-all solution in this matter and the medical evolution of this therapy will certainly bring out even more challenges. Comprehensive knowledge of the intellectual property, exposure to potential litigation, growing competition, and the high price of therapy, are strikingly relevant in the broader landscape. Future endeavors would be to take steps toward the harmonization of the CAR-T patenting procedure.\n",
            "Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive type of liver cancer with few effective treatment options. Therefore, there is great need to better understand the biology of this malignancy to further development of novel treatment options. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to the underlying reason for cancer initiation, metastasis, and relapse. However, due to their elusive character and differences in identification among different types of cancer, it remains a challenge to study such cells. Additionally, characterization of the tumor microenvironment such as interactions with immune cells remain largely unknown. Here, we employ a fluorescent reporter system to track and isolate stem-like cancer cells of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Following verification of a stem-like signature (upregulated expression of stemness markers, resistance to chemotherapy, increased spheroid formation, and tumorigenesis capabilities despite inoculation of a small number of cells), we analyzed the interaction of these cells with macrophages via direct and indirect coculture assays. We noted direct coculturing increased stemness among CSC populations and induced both M1 (CD80 and HLA-DR) and M2 (CD163) tumor associated macrophage polarization. These studies suggest that there is a bi-directional crosstalk between macrophages and CSCs that promotes stemness renewal and tumor associated macrophage polarization.\n",
            "Taking care of a relative with dementia may be linked to negative consequences for the caregiver. One of the processes that can be experienced is anticipatory grief, that is defined as the feelings of pain and loss that appear in the caregiver before the death of the person cared for.\n",
            "The review aimed to conceptualize anticipatory grief in this population, to study the related psychosocial variables, and to know the repercussions for the health of the caregiver.\n",
            "A systematic search was made under the directives of PRISMA statement in the ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus databases, including studies published in the last 10 years (2013-2023).\n",
            "A total of 160 articles were obtained, 15 being finally selected. It is observed that anticipatory grief is defined as an ambiguous process since it appeared before the death of the sick family member. Being a female caregiver, spouse of a family member with dementia, having a closer relationship with him and/or having an important responsibility in care, are associated with a greater chance of experiencing anticipatory grief. In relation to the person cared for, if he or she is in a severe phase of the disease, is younger, and/or presents problematic behaviours, there is also greater anticipatory grief in the family caregiver. Anticipatory grief has a significant impact on caregivers' physical, psychological, and social health, being associated with greater burden, depressive symptomatology, and social isolation.\n",
            "Anticipatory grief turns out to be a relevant concept in the context of dementia, being necessary to include it in intervention programs for this population.\n",
            "Cholera, being a global health issue has remarkably affected the wellness of the people, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it could be more if no concrete Intervention is done to curtail the outbreak. The authors reviewed past and present literatures on cholera and COVID-19 from the year 2013-2023 in well renowned scientific journals such as PUBMED, ResearchGate, Google Scholar. Database servers of these journals were accessed based on their permissions. From this search the authors found that, cholera is at its peak amidst COVID in DRC. Between the 10 March 2020 to the 10 March 2022, DRC reported a total of 86 462 cases of COVID-19 in 314 health zones in all 26 provinces of the country, with 1335 deaths recorded. And since the beginning of 2022, 6692 suspected cholera cases including 107 deaths have been reported in 54 health zones in 11 provinces of DRC, compared with 3681 suspected cases and 91 deaths reported during the same period in 2021 in 67 health zones in 14 provinces in the country. The authors realized that despite all efforts to mitigate the spread of cholera in DRC by the Congolese government and the non-governmental organizations in the country, there are still some gaps required to be filled, such as; limited community mobilizations and awareness campaigns about the signs and symptoms of cholera and COVID-19, unavailability of free cholera and COVID-19 vaccines to all the Congolese populations as well as association of witchcraft to diseases. etc. Hence, to mitigate this menace, the authors urge the Congolese government to utilize research implementation strategies such as increase mass awareness campaigns on cholera and COVID among the Congolese populations as well as training workshops for the religious and traditional leaders as well as the healthcare providers in the country for a better diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.\n",
            "Owing to the rise in global population and living standards, waste treatment has inevitably become a critical issue for a sustainable environment. In particular, for an effective recycling process, it is vital to disassemble different types of materials by removing adhesives used in the packaging. However, this removal process requires harsh solvents (acidic and organic) that are unfriendly to nature and may cause additional pollution. To address this issue, functional adhesive materials that can be removed without the use of harsh solvents have drawn significant attention. One promising approach is to utilize the stimuli-responsive polymers to synthesize pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs); however, it is technically challenging to simultaneously satisfy (i) strong initial adhesion (without stimulus), (ii) stimuli-responsive sufficient reduction of adhesion, and (iii) reversibility. In this study, thermo-switchable PSAs were synthesized by copolymerizing \n",
            "Recently, it has been shown that metabolites derived from endosymbiotic fungi attracted high attention, since plenty of them have promising pharmaceutical applications. The variation of metabolic pathways in fungi is considered an optimistic source for lead compounds. Among these classes are terpenoids, alkaloids, polyketides, and steroids, which have proved several pharmacological activities, including antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral actions. This review concludes the major isolated compounds from different strains of Penicillium chrysogenum during the period 2013-2023, together with their reported pharmacological activities. From literature surveys, 277 compounds have been identified from P. chrysogenum, which has been isolated as an endosymbiotic fungus from different host organisms, with specific attention paid to those showing marked biological activities that could be useful in the pharmaceutical industry in the future. This review represents documentation for a valuable reference for promising pharmaceutical applications or further needed studies on P. chrysogenum.\n",
            "Bacterial and fungal infections are common issues for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Large, multinational point prevalence surveys have identified that up to 50% of ICU patients have a diagnosis of bacterial or fungal infection at any one time. Infection in the ICU is associated with its own challenges. Causative organisms often harbour intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of drug-resistance, making empiric and targeted antimicrobial selection challenging. Infection in the ICU is associated with worse clinical outcomes for patients. We review the epidemiology of bacterial and fungal infection in the ICU. We discuss risk factors for acquisition, approaches to diagnosis and management, and common strategies for the prevention of infection.\n",

            "(1) Background: Emotional eating is considered as the propensity to eat in response to emotions. It is considered as a critical risk factor for recurrent weight gain. Such overeating is able to affect general health due to excess energy intake and mental health. So far, there is still considerable controversy on the effect of the emotional eating concept. The objective of this study is to summarize and evaluate the interconnections among emotional eating and overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and dietary patterns; (2) Methods: This is a thorough review of the reported associations among emotional eating and overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and dietary patterns. We compressively searched the most precise scientific online databases, e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar to obtain the most up-to-date data from clinical studies in humans from the last ten years (2013-2023) using critical and representative keywords. Several inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied for scrutinizing only longitudinal, cross-sectional, descriptive, and prospective clinical studies in Caucasian populations; (3) Results: The currently available findings suggest that overeating/obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g., fast food consumption) are associated with emotional eating. Moreover, the increase in depressive symptoms seems to be related with more emotional eating. Psychological distress is also related with a greater risk for emotional eating. However, the most common limitations are the small sample size and their lack of diversity. In addition, a cross-sectional study was performed in the majority of them; (4) Conclusions: Finding coping mechanisms for the negative emotions and nutrition education can prevent the prevalence of emotional eating. Future studies should further explain the underlying mechanisms of the interconnections among emotional eating and overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and dietary patterns.\n",

            "In 2000, the Japanese government launched the National Health Promotion Movement known as Health Japan 21 (HJ21), a 13-year national health promotion policy (2000-2012) aimed at preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their underlying risk factors. After the revision in 2013 (2013-2023), the target NCDs and risk factors are being reviewed and a new strategy for the third term of HJ21 is going to be discussed. Using the latest findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, this paper highlights NCDs that continue to increase health losses and preventable metabolic and behavioural risk factors. These NCDs and risk factors are associated with an increased risk of serious illness and death from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The third term of HJ21 will be formulated during the continuing threat of acute health crises like the current COVID-19 pandemic and thus offers an important opportunity to renew public health efforts to halt the growing burden of NCDs in Japan. This article may serve as one of the roadmaps for the formulation of the third term of HJ21.\n",
            "Coronavirus disease 2019 has a wide range of clinical spectrum from asymptomatic infection to severe infection resulting in death within a short time. Currently, it is known that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) does not only cause a respiratory tract infection but a more complicated disease that can lead to multiple system involvement including the liver. Herein, we evaluate the epidemiology, the impact of liver injury/ dysfunction on disease prognosis, the pathophysiological mechanisms and management of liver injury. More than one-fourth of the patients have abnormal liver function tests, mostly a mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction. Liver injury is significantly associated with a poor clinical outcome. Direct cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2, the immune response (\"cytokine storm\"), the complications related to the disease, and drugs used in the treatments are the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for liver injury. However, the exact mechanism is not yet clearly explained. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and entering the hepatocyte and cholangiocytes can cause cytotoxic effects on the liver. Excessive immune response has an important role in disease progression and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failures accompanied by liver injury. Treatment drugs, particularly lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir and antibiotics are a frequent reason for liver injury. The possible reasons should be meticulously investigated and resolved.\n",

This is the first study to assess the day-to-day reliability of passive leg movement-induced hyperaemia (PLM-H), an index of lower-limb microvascular function, in young, healthy women. What is the main finding and its importance? Passive leg movement-induced hyperaemia demonstrated good day-to-day reliability, comparable to other common indices of endothelial function, supporting the use of PLM-H to assess lower-limb microvascular function in women.\n",
            "Passive leg movement-elicited hyperaemia (PLM-H) provides an index of lower-limb microvascular function. However, there is currently limited information regarding the reliability of PLM-H and no reliability information specific to women. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of PLM-H in women on two separate days. Seventeen young, healthy women [22 ± 3 years old (mean ± SD)] participated in two identical visits including three trials of PLM. Using duplex ultrasound, PLM-H was characterized by six indices: peak leg blood flow (LBF) and vascular conductance (LVC), peak change above baseline (Δpeak) for LBF and LVC, and area under the curve above baseline (AUC) during the first 60 s of PLM for LBF and LVC. The results demonstrated good day-to-day reliability of PLM-H characterized as peak LBF [r = 0.84, P < 0.001; intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.84; coefficient of variation (CV) = 13.2%], peak LVC (r = 0.82, P < 0.001; ICC = 0.79; CV = 14.4%), Δpeak LBF (r = 0.83, P < 0.001; ICC = 0.82; CV = 17.8%) and Δpeak LVC (r = 0.83, P < 0.001; ICC = 0.80; CV = 16.5%). Characterization of PLM as AUC demonstrated moderate day-to-day reliability: AUC LBF (r = 0.71, P < 0.05; ICC = 0.70; CV = 31.2%) and AUC LVC (r = 0.78, P < 0.001; ICC = 0.74; CV = 27.1%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PLM-H has good reliability as an index of microvascular function; however, characterization of PLM-H as peak, Δpeak LBF and LVC is more reliable than AUC.\n"
